Image Slider :- 

I developed an Image Slider using React, designed to showcase a series of images in a carousel format. The slider features automatic image transitions every 2 seconds, implemented using the useEffect hook with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. The useState hook manages the currently active image index, while buttons for "Previous" and "Next" allow manual navigation. The slider also supports cyclic navigation, ensuring seamless transitions between the first and last images. The project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic and interactive components using React and highlights my understanding of React hooks and state management.
The Image Slider project in React involves creating a component that displays a series of images, allowing users to navigate through them either manually or automatically. It typically involves using React state to manage the current image being displayed and event handlers to respond to user interactions. In the Image Slider project, the `setTimeout` function is integrated within the `useEffect` hook to automate the display of images. By employing `setTimeout` within `useEffect`, the project orchestrates automatic image transitions at predefined intervals, enhancing the user experience with a dynamic slideshow. This implementation optimizes performance by managing side effects and ensuring efficient resource allocation.
